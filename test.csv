SWEAT can kick-start that positive feedback loop for people’s physical and mental health.&lt;br&gt;Consider the purpose of SWEAT. We want people to get moving because we hope, by incentivizing one contributing factor to general well-being, we can play a part in bringing about that well-being to a greater number of people.&lt;/p&gt;"

What is Meta Apes  Game?,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;Meta Apes is a free-to-play, play-and-earn MMO strategy game. It is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in which humanity has ended and a new era ruled by Apes has begun. Next on the agenda is space domination. Each pri-mate (yes, you) will have to work closely with their Gang to become the strongest Clan and win the ultimate race to space.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
What makes Meta Apes  unique?,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;The biggest differences between Meta Apes and another web2 mobile game are decentralization and ownership. This means the game-related data lives on the blockchain instead of a centralized server that is fully controlled by the game studio and as such the players are able to truly own the assets that they earn from investing their time and/or resources. With true ownership, players are then able to trade or sell these assets freely and also earn while playing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;In the web3 gaming landscape, we saw an opportunity to create an experience that appeals to both traditional and blockchain gamers alike. Meta Apes was born out of this idea of creating a community-oriented game that offers both audiences something valuable - 1) an opportunity for the traditional gamers to earn &amp;amp; truly own their in-game assets and 2) a much more interactive and enjoyable experience for the blockchain gamers who are primarily looking to earn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
How many Meta Apes  NFT are there?,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;First, NFT fighters generate SHELL, which is the utility token and in-game currency in Meta Apes. The amount of SHELL generated will depend on the rarity of the NFT fighter. Second, they come equipped with more skills and will have 1-3 extra skills in addition to the default skills available for non-NFT fighters. Additionally, each skill will also have increased strength and power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;Besides additional skills and power, they also come with special effects that make your fighters more fun! Think different backgrounds, lighting, halo &amp;amp; display of user ID, which non-NFT fighters do not have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;Lastly, having an NFT fighter will help you identify which second fighter would create the strongest and the most powerful bond when paired with your existing NFT fighter. When your fighter reaches a certain level, then you’ll be able to send your fighters to battles in pairs. If you have an NFT fighter, there will be a way for you to be able to identify which other fighter would be best paired with yours, which will be hugely helpful as you progress through the game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;As of today, there are 3 different types of rarity available for the NFT fighters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

It utilizes in-game NFTs as assets, collectibles, and utilities. In-game assets are all blockchain collectibles that users utilize in playing the game. As blockchain-based items, in-game assets can be freely withdrawn from the game for other uses such as collateral on decentralized lending protocol, staking, gifting, or passing it down as an inheritance. In-game assets can be seen as a commodity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"

We introduce NFT technology in our games as consumable utilities supplemented by the known use cases as collectibles and assets. Fabwelt also introduces the concept of Universal NFTs where different NFTs can be used as different assets or utilities on all the games. For example, an NFT can represent a weapon in Arsenal, but also a car in a racing game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;Using NFTs as consumable utilities means players can use specific NFTs to trigger special features/actions during gameplay. A few examples are: Making the character run faster for a short period; Opening doors/boxes; Giving your opponents a cloudy vision for a short time; Activating infinite ammo; Looking through walls Increase building speed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;The number of use cases that could be used this way is unlimited. But they all give the players the same thing, a strategic advantage over their opponents. These NFTs as utilities can only be used once so it&apos;s always limited to the amount of a specific NFT the player owns. The NFTs can be bought and traded on the Fabwwelt NFT market like normal NFTs and are graded depending on how special the utility it provides during gameplay. Many common NFTs can be used as utilities across the Fabwelt gaming platform but some will be game-specific. When an NFT is used by its owner during the game, the NFT will not be burned but transferred back to the stock to be sold again to a new owner. This creates a circular ecosystem of in-game NFTs and sustains the Fabwelt gaming platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;These NFTs are based on ERC1155 technology and a sufficient stock for every NFT will be created. The price of an NFT varies on different aspects like rareness and the amount of impact an NFT has on the game strategy. As Fabwelt will organize regular worldwide tournaments for all games, selecting and buying the NFTs will become part of the strategy of the gamer to get that advantage over its opponents and win the prize pool. When NFTs are bought by gamers they are also sustaining the Fabwelt ecosystem. We also introduce ultra-rare NFTs that will give an owner a very special utility during gameplay. These NFTs cannot be bought but only be earned by staking the Fabwelt token. An owner of such NFT can sell it on the known NFT markets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;The whole in-game NFT structure that Fabwelt introduces will give great fun and strategic excitement to all gamers and especially professional gamers during tournaments.

In the future, players will be a part of multiplayer shared spaces and engage in thrilling multiplayer competitions."
What makes Mines of Dalarnia unique?,"Mines of Dalarnia offers two distinct Game Roles:
- Miners: Miners access mining plots to gather resources and fight monsters in a sidescrolling-mining game.
Mines of Dalarnia is a 2D sidescroller where the player controls a character. The character comes equipped with a tool that they can use to break blocks to mine and a weapon to fight enemies. Each level is procedurally generated with hazards (enemies, falling blocks, traps) and resources. During mining players fight monsters and destroy blocks of different qualities to get points which contribute to their high score. This high score determines the quality and quantity of resources and maybe even loot they receive after their mining session.
- Land Owners: Land Owners own and manage Mining Plots that they lease for other players to mine within.
Players have the option of either buying or renting plots of land. Players that buy a land plot NFT claim ‘ownership’ of that plot, and can then rent it to others. They may also mine their own land for free, but doing so contributes to resource depletion on their plot. Renting plots is generally far cheaper than buying plots, but does not come with the benefits (and responsibility) of ownership. Players that rent a plot gain one time access to that plot by paying a fee denominated in DAR. This fee is paid to the owner of the plot.
"
How many Mines of Dalarnia NFT are there?,"The majority of in-game land plots (LAND), which are used for mining, are player owned. Each LAND plot is unique, with a different distribution of resources, and more attributes of each piece of LAND will be unveiled over time as the game is expanded. LAND owners must actively take care of their mining plots with Terraforming Capsules in order to remain attractive for miners."

What is BattleFly NFT Game?,"&lt;p&gt;BattleFly is a deep strategy game, where the best BattleFlys can generate outsized rewards. Compete head to head against other players in the Hyperdome and strategize with community members in the Discord.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The key to victory is assembling the best combination of mods for your machine. Simply spending top dollar on the best mods won’t guarantee success. Players need to assemble mods that work in synergy with their battlefly. Mod load-outs that work well at lower ranks, might not necessarily work as well at high ranks. With constantly shifting meta and an ever evolving game, players must be actively reading the game and shifting their strategy to ensure their BattleFly’s are winning at least 52% of their battles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"
What makes BattleFly unique?,"Players start the game by releasing their BattleFly NFT from its cocoon, kickstarting its four week Genesis phase. Over the next 30 days, players seek to maximize both the yield and load-out of their BattleFly before it starts its ascension to Earth, ready for Season 2 to begin. 
At the heart of the game are The Hyperdomes — futuristic combat arenas featuring rolling PvP combat where BattleFlys are randomly selected to battle. Players stake their BattleFlys in a Hyperdome with $Magic and accrue yield simply by surviving. Slowly, but inevitably, superior BattleFlys capture the $Magic from weaker BattleFlys.
While resting in The Garden, BattleFlys salvage BattleMods, weapons, shields and other utility items that are gradually unearthed. Players can elect to deploy or discard newly salvaged mods, designing their own unique insect assassin."
How many BattleFly NFT are there?,"The BattleFly game launches with five NFTs: 
- Cocoons are a prelude to gameplay; each cocoon contains one BattleFly-in- waiting. 
- Each BattleFly emerges from the cocoon with randomly generated wing armor. Each BattleFly also starts with four base mods - randomly selected from more than 250 weapons, shields and utilities that give BattleFlys their unique combat abilities.
- AI Trait Cards (available later in Season 1) power the ten Artificial Intelligence factions that fight for control of the metaverse, using BattleFly as their proxy.
- Founders NFTs are sold by the project to boost our Treasury. In addition to extending the battery life of a BattleFly, they also entitle the holder to governance rights and bonus emissions when staking $Magic. 
- Nectar is a consumable NFT that sustains and enhances a BattleFly’s performance. It has multiple uses across the game, and is required to both recharge BattleFlys and initiate cloning. 
"
How does BattleFly work?,"&lt;p&gt;Strategically build your BattleFly for combat, choosing from 290+ mods&lt;br&gt;Stake MAGIC &amp;nbsp;to battle head to head against other BattleFlies and win (or lose) MAGIC based on the outcome of each battle&lt;br&gt;Watch as your BattleFly competes throughout the day, battling between 10 to 100 times other BattleFlys.&lt;br&gt;Implement the best strategy, win the most battles, earn the most rewards!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Your BattleFly comes equipped with 4 starting mods. You then roll mod packs for the chance of upgrading your mods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"
BattleFly Gameplay Overview,"&lt;p&gt;BattleFly’s main gameplay mode is Battlegrounds. Series of 1vs1 pvp battles that last between 10 to 30 seconds.&lt;br&gt;The game can be played on either PC or mobile, available for Android and iOS. You also need to have a crypto wallet installed like Metamask to purchase a BattleFly.&lt;br&gt;It’s a PVP idle combat game where players compete for the top leaderboards prizes against all other players. The combat is ruled by a detailed combat engine taking into account individual BattleFLy stats and random variables.&lt;br&gt;The four mod slots and the optimization of builds through synergies and combos are the main strategy layer of the game. Players can also build their BattleFLy to be farmers, assassins or warriors in order to get different benefits from the game.&lt;/p&gt;"
How to make money in BattleFly?,"&lt;p&gt;Players can earn in the following ways &amp;nbsp;Battle Winnings: Earn 0.095 MAGIC from each Battle won. Daily Leaderboard Payout: Place at the top of the daily leaderboards to earn daily MAGIC rewards ranging from 5 MAGIC at the lower ranks up to 100 MAGIC at the most competitive, APEX rank. Nectar: Players will earn the in-game currency, Nectar everytime they lose a battle. Nectar is the lifeblood of BattleFly and can be used to re-roll mod packs for different pods, and try to upgrade the rarity of mods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"

What makes Mocossi Planet unique?,"&lt;p&gt;We believe in science, and the blockchain behind Cardano adheres to that.

So far Charles Hoskinson and his team have published over 140 papers, laying a solid foundation for not just Cardano but cryptocurrency in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardano blockchain requires reasonable gas fees to process transactions. Cardano’s fee structure is designed to stymie fee explosion, a problem we have seen with Ethereum lately. The average transaction fee on the Ethereum network skyrocketed from roughly $16 in May to $63 in November 2021. In contrast, the average gas fee for Cardano was just around $0.3 during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardano’s vision for a “decentralized Africa” is huge. We are talking about 5 million students and teachers in Ethiopia who will soon acquire blockchain-based digital identities.

First, the gameplay needs to be exciting and engaging. VoxNet was created by top gaming engineers who have tested all aspects of the gameplay to ensure that the battle arena environment is unique, fun, and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the game needs to have stunning graphics.

That includes dramatic sunsets, moonlit nights, and stunning daylight motifs. The game even features intriguing NPCs (non-playable characters) such as butterflies and other elements that add another level of realism to the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a successful game needs to have a thriving and growing community that wants to be a part of the game on a long-term basis.

As you will see in a later section, VoxNet has created attractive play-to-earn and staking rewards for participants.&lt;/p&gt;"
How many VoxNET NFT are there?,"&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to keep players participating in a game is to give them a real sense of ownership and investment in their players. That’s why VoxNet is offering over 5,000 unique NFT characters that participants can purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Itchy NFT character will have their unique appearance and traits along with specific game capabilities. The NFTs will hold the player’s stats which will be utilized in a global stat system of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All stats are transferable when the NFT is sold. As an example, if a player NFT has +10 ATK on his NFT, then the new owner of the NFT will receive that +10 ATK. Thus, players who win and score more kills and victories with their character will hold more valuable NFTs. This will create an exciting incentive for players to make the most of their characters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"

Scout the transfer market for undervalued gems, or sell your club legends to reinvest in your squad&apos;sfuture. Being savvy in the market is key to success.

To make your team perform, you’ll need to choose the right tactics, line-ups and approach to out-wit your opponent. You’ll then get to watch the game play out live in-real time, watching the display, reading the commentary and responding to in-game situations with live tactical changes and substitutions.

Creating squad cohesion is important, and having disgruntled players will only lead to poor performance. You can’t just spend your way to victory, you have to establish a culture that has the whole club pulling in the right direction. Being a consistently absent manager will be penalised as your team lose faith in you."

What is F1 Dog Game?,"&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:hsl(0, 0%, 30%);&quot;&gt;F1 Dog is a Race-to-earn game, which is created to digitize the traditional greyhound racing industry&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Players can own dogs, train dogs, breed, and use them to participate in races without being pre-equipped with the knowledge of traditional dog racing or requiring a lot of gaming skills. Therefore, anyone can join the game and earn money easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
What makes F1 Dog unique?,"&lt;p&gt;We expect that in the future, F1 Dog will be part of our company&apos;s metaverse ecosystem. Through that, players will be able to make the most of the resources for the best experience.&lt;br&gt;For most games on the market, when players want to withdraw money from one game to switch to another game, they have to sell the item into a token, then convert it back to another game&apos;s token, and then buy in-game items. These stages are very complicated and cost a lot of gas. For our metaverse ecosystem, we&apos;re going to make the transition as concise as possible. Players can directly convert items of equal value from game to game in the ecosystem through a system&apos;s conversion channel, and receive items instantly in the new game.&lt;br&gt;For example, when you have an NFT racing in F1 Dog, and our company releases a new game (a car racing game for example), you can convert the NFT racing dog directly into an NFT car and get it in a car racing game inventory right away with only 1 gas fee.&lt;/p&gt;"
How many F1 Dog NFT are there?,"&lt;p&gt;All player who wants to participate in races needs their own NFT racing dog. These NFTs can be found in the marketplace or in open mystery boxes.&lt;br&gt;An NFT racing dog&apos;s rarity will be separated into 5 ranks. The higher the rank, the better the stats and the more energy there will be, allowing the racing dog to compete in more races. Better performance and increased revenue for owners result from this. They also have 5 attributes corresponding to different powers:&lt;/p&gt;"
Who are the developers of F1 Dog?,"&lt;p&gt;Our team with experienced and enthusiastic people always tries to bring the best things to users. We hope that with F1 Dog, we will help players both entertain themselves after stressful working hours and earn money through Play and Earn. Moreover, with this game, we want to bring GameFi to more people, contributing to the development of this particular industry.&lt;/p&gt;"

How to increase values of their Space Hubs ,"&lt;p&gt;We believe that incentivizing creativity among Space Hub owners paves way to longevity and greatness of platform quality. Hence, the following are some of the proposed ways the users have to consider in order to increase values of their Space Hubs:&lt;br&gt;Annually, Space Hubs are ranked and the ones that make it to the top 15 are to be included in the&lt;br&gt;ASTRO XP Featured Map.&lt;br&gt;1. The value of Space Hubs is determined by daily space hub visits/traffic, VLX transaction volumes, and Space Hub ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Users could purchase name credits for Space Hubs. The name could be sold or traded peer-to-peer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Short and long-term collaborations among creators are enabled by creating in-world contracts to be implemented by the N.E.X.U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Early gamers could avail hubs in great VLX amount which would put leverage on top of creative incentives should the owner consider optimizing the space in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time passes by, new and empty space hubs for newcomers would require less to no VLX’s to avail. Hence, no leverage and would define its value only through the worth of its hub analytics and cost of operation.&lt;/p&gt;"

Our NFTs act like game assets and are therefore utilities in-game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our NFTs need to be burned or bred for the player to be able to get further into the game. Just like the planet itself, the game architecture will evolve over time. This means further depth in Play-to-Earn, Defi, and many other features and mechanics. We believe this will create a truly immersive and groundbreaking gaming experience.&lt;/p&gt;"
What makes Planet IX unique?,"&lt;p&gt;Planet IX is not like any old game with a simple beginning, end, and happily ever after. It is an evolving eco-system of multi-layered player journeys. Planet IX is a bridge between the digital and the physical world where environments can be claimed, bought, and sold. Environments that will eventually also be customizable; enabling and encouraging both creativity and strategizing for the individual player.&lt;/p&gt;"
How does Planet IX work?,"&lt;p&gt;As a new player you can acquire land through GG Pack drops or through the marketplace. Your mission is to connect enough land pieces on the globe to form territories which you stake for IXT rewards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also utilize your land in Mission Control where you have to stake land to start cleaning the planet. If you do not have any land you can raid other players and help clean their land but keep the bounty. The bounty is Waste, which you can process or burn to receive other consumable NFTs in your road to building facilities and begin to farm Energy. Energy is created from Facilities and later staked for IXT or Planet IX rewards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching mission is to restore the planet to its former green and blue glory.&lt;/p&gt;"
Planet IX Gameplay Overview,&lt;p&gt;In Planet IX you can connect your Land to earn IXT. You’ll also be able to farm your way to the IXT without investing anything other than your time. Connect your land and help rejuvenate the broken lands and Build the Planet of Tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

What is Mushro Legends  Game?,&lt;p&gt;Play-to-earn games are&lt;strong&gt; games in which the main goal is to earn&lt;/strong&gt;. The game’s progress revolves around getting profit. Games like this are usually built-in NFT or blockchain technology and produce currency that can be traded for fiat or other coins.&lt;/p&gt;
What makes Mushro Legends  unique?,"&lt;p&gt;The P2E game hit the crypto market last year. There are still a lot of P2E games out there in the making or already launched. Most of them are just rugs and some of them have potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most of them don&apos;t last long and even the famous ones have difficult times maintaining their popularity. Why is this happening?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifespan, Reality, and Limitations of the P2E Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the tremendous success of Axie Infinity, P2E NFT game becomes the mainstream of the crypto tokens and tens of game tokens launches every day on the market. Axie infinity was the main source of income in Southeast Asia countries including the Philippines last year. Some warned that it&apos;s just a rug pull and will be forgotten very soon but it&apos;s still going on and even the large traditional game companies are joining the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most of the P2E games show the same cycle, causing losses to lots of crypto investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P2E game Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the P2E game is to make money by playing the game as a goal, but almost all P2E games that have come out to date are just gamification of the Defi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game itself is not enjoyable or funny at all. It just takes your time and is boring. You are playing it only because you can make some profits. The quality of the games is very primitive - some of them are not even playable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do differently in Mushro Legends then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A game is enjoyable only when you compete with others and feel a sense of accomplishment and you get ahead of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied famous game models in the market and designed the gameplay in an enjoyable and fun way in the long run. Fierce competition is also a strong point of our game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reward system of Mushro Legends is also different than other games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reward users in BUSD, not in our token (GDOGE). But we encourage users to purchase in-game currencies with the GDOGE token. Of course, we will sell some of them for in-game rewards, but we will burn at least half of them. This is completely different than other games in which the liquidity of the reward token keeps drying because of the players selling every day. We have full control over the GDOGE token, and this will ensure the token price keeps going up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the Mushro Legends can be playable with in-app purchases on Apple Store and Google Play Store which is open to those who don&apos;t know cryptocurrency or NFTs. This gives us more exposure and eventually leads us to a bright future.&lt;/p&gt;"

What makes Revival of Avalanche unique?,"&lt;p&gt;From the in-game economy perspective, the P2E concept is yet&lt;br&gt;to prove itself in a bear market. In many cases, there is an element of a pyramid scheme in many of those games. If new gamers stop coming in, the old players don’t get paid as much or at all, and the project becomes obsolete. We are tackling this problem by introducing a peer-to-peer, skillto-earn-based model at its core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of this model will ensure usability beyond speculating on the underlying token asset alone and provide utility within an extensive in-game economy for short and long-term players and long-term passive investors who want to be part of the game non-actively. Peer to Peer gaming modes, like PVP wager wars, Tournaments will always intrigue players to earn while practicing the game, no matter what the state of the broad market sentiment is. Studies show that the gaming industry in general does not suffer economic downfalls. It becomes cheaper to play the games and be substantially entertained than to entertain traveling abroad for a holiday, as an extreme rudimentary example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROA resembles other famous fighting games like Tekken, Street Fighter, and Mortal Kombat.

Games from the competition such as Axie don&apos;t have this kind of mode.

Players will be able to shoot in any direction using semi-automatic weapons, and will be able to hide in the bushes all over the map. In the Public game mode, players are paired into public matches, and play for fun and to improve their skills. Regarding the Private mode, if a player holds more than $50 in BITCAT tokens, he automatically gets access to a tool which will allow him to host a private match with 9 other friends, so that they can also enjoy the game with friends! In the last game mode, the Earning mode, players will have to pay a certain fee to get into it, starting at $3 in BITCAT&lt;/p&gt;"
Bitcat Game Gameplay Overview,"&lt;p&gt;We have 3 game modes: public, private parties and public earning (betting).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Players will join real time matches featuring different cats and will be able to engage in fierce combats to show their skills over the rest of the players. Every player will have a semi-automatic weapon that can shoot in any direction and inflicts an amount of damage to other players, which will result in them losing a life. Each player will have 3 lives and when they run out, they will &amp;nbsp;lose. Eventually, there will be only one player standing, who will be the winner and will take the prize.&lt;/p&gt;"
